Programs were developed using the MPICH2 implementation of MPI

Compiled in the Linux terminal using the Makefile

Creates an executable file - MonteCarlo

This program computes the Monte Carlo approximation of a multidimensional
integral.

MonteCarlo is envoked with: 
	mpirun -np <#processes> ./MonteCarlo n a1 a2 ... an b1 b2 ... bn N
	
	where n is the dimension of the integral, a1 - an are the lower bounds
	of the integrals, b1 - bn are the upper bounds of the integrals, and
	N is the number of sample points to be used. The larger the N, the 
	closer to the exact value the result will be.

main.c - parses arguements to the command line, initializes and closes the
	     MPI environment, and passses the arguements to the processes.

parallel-monte-carlo.c - Each process runs this function; determines how
						 many points that process should estimate and
						 computes the Monte Carlo approximation of an
						 integral.
						
monte-carlo.c - generates random points to be used to compute the 
				approximation N times and sums the result.
				
fcn.c - stores the formula of integral being computed. This function can be
		altered to compute other integrals.
		
check-result.c - a testing function. Put any code used for testing the
				 program in this file.
